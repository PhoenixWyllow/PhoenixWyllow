## Welcome weary wanderer 👋

It seems you've found one of my little corners of the web.

***

**I'm Will.**

I work full-time as a MS Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations Developer \
👨‍💻 but I'm also a C# enthusiast \
📚 ...and an [editor](#editing-credits) of adult fantasy, sci-fi and grimdark novels and stories \
📸 ...and a hobbyist photographer \
🔭 ...who studied Physics and Astronomy \
✍️ ...and I write sporadic thoughts on [my blog](https://lunavisions.altervista.org) 


## Editing credits

- [Freddie A. Clark](https://freddieaclark.com/) and her marvelous world of gritty fantasy/grimdark goodness.

If you're interested in having your work edited or proofread by me, I have a separate email for that: russell.editing@outlook.com

## Nerd by day, Music lover by night 

Talk to me about code, astronomy, books, tabletop games, ttRPGs, synthwave, agrotech, industrial, pagan folk, LGBT+ topics...a lot of stuff.
Also, feel free to talk to me in English or Italian.


## LGBT+ friendly space

🏳️‍🌈 My pronouns aren't important, so choose freely, but if you want to know: I generally use He/Him.


## I like tea AND coffee
