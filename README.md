## Welcome weary wanderer 👋
It seems you've found one of my little corners of the web.

***
**I'm Will.**

I work full-time as a MS Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations Developer <br/>
👨‍💻 but I'm also a C# enthusiast <br/>
📚 ...and an editor for [Freddie A. Clark](https://freddieaclark.com/) and her marvelous world of gritty fantasy/grimdark goodness <br/>
📸 ...and a hobbyist photographer <br/>
🔭 ...who studied Physics and Astronomy <br/>
✍️ ...and I write sporadic thoughts on [my blog](https://lunavisions.altervista.org) <br/>

### Nerd by day, Music lover by night 

Talk to me about code, astronomy, books, tabletop games, ttRPGs, synthwave, agrotech, industrial, pagan folk, LGBT+ topics...a lot of stuff.
Also, feel free to talk to me in English or Italian.

### LGBT+ friendly space

🏳️‍🌈 My pronouns aren't important, so choose freely, but if you want to know: I generally use He/Him.

### I like tea AND coffee
