### Welcome weary wanderer 👋
It seems you've found one of my little corners of the web.
***
I'm Will.

I work full-time as a MS Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations Developer
👨‍💻 but I'm also a C# enthusiast 
📚 ...and an editor for [Freddie A. Clark](https://freddieaclark.com/) and her marvelous world of gritty fantasy/grimdark goodness
📸 ...and a hobbyist photographer
🔭 ...who studied Physics and Astronomy
📝 ...and I write sporadic thoughts on [my blog](https://lunavisions.altervista.org)

#### Nerd by day, Music lover by night 

Talk to me about code, astronomy, books, tabletop games, ttRPGs, synthwave, agrotech, industrial, pagan folk, LGBT+ topics...a lot of stuff.
Also, feel free to talk to me in English or Italian.

#### LGBT+ friendly space

🌈 My pronouns aren't important, so choose freely, but if you want to know: I generally use He/Him.

#### I like tea AND coffee
